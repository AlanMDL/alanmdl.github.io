Hello there! My name is Alan Marin, welcome. :)

I am currently a junior at Cal State Long Beach majoring in Computer Science. Currently expecting to graduate Spring 2022. I am currently working for inHealth as a Research Intern and Front End Developer.

I am liking to further my studies in computer science and hopefully get a career in software engineering. I also like to learn about entrepreneurship and the various opportunities out there.

Previously, I have worked on building and scaling mobile ios/android applications for Healthy South Kern - Building Healthy Communities, a non-profit dedicated to increasing the quality of life for all californians who are living on the margins. I have also worked as a Ag Engineering Research Intern at Cal State Bakersfield developing more methodologies to increase the efficiency of how farming irrigation is conducted.

My hobbies come and go, but I am into software engineering, social media, finance, lifting weights, and making music.

Have any questions? Contact Me at:
