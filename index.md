Hi! My name is Alan Marin.

I am currently a junior at Cal State Long Beach majoring in computer science. Currently expecting to graduate Spring 2022. I am liking to further study the fundamentals of CompSci/Data Structures and Full Stack Web Development while I am still in college. I spend my time learning about software development and learning about the current landscape of opportunity out there. Social Media, Computer Technology, and debating technologies is what I'm interested in.

Previously, I have worked on building and scaling mobile ios/android applications for Healthy South Kern - Building Healthy Communities. I have also worked as a Ag Engineering Research Intern at Cal State Bakersfield. 

My hobbies come and go, but I am into social media, competitive gaming, fincance, lifting weights, and making music.
